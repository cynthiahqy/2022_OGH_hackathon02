### Questions

-   how to set column roles? -- [mlr3book section](https://mlr3book.mlr-org.com/basics.html#tasks-roles)

``` r
task_ds801
task_ds801$data()
task_ds801$feature_names

## setting roles
# task_ds801$col_roles$group = "state"
task_ds801$col_roles$group

## setting 

task_ds801$target_names
```

-   what's the difference between 'blocking' and 'group' column roles?
    -   see [class manual](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/Task.html) for `Task`
    -   use `"group"` role for site_id -- only takes one column
    -   use `"stratum"` role for blocking variables -- can take multiple columns

```{r}
## does setting the roles change the feature set?
task_ds801$feature_names
```
